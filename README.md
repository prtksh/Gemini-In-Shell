# Gemini-In-Shell

A Python script that you can download and run in your terminal to access Gemini (model: 1.5-Pro on the free tier), for a chat or query. Only textual content to-and-fro (for now).

> [!WARNING]  
> This project is made to run on Linux systems. You need to have a GEMINI-API-KEY already in your environment (or .bashrc) file for you to connect to Gemini.
